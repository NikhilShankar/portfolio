- Analyzed, profiled, and reduced network latency by ~18-20%, resulting in faster transaction completion time across the fintech app.
- Ensured quality of deliverables by mentoring Junior developers, doing extensive code reviews and walkthroughs and by helping to adhere to best coding practices.
- Optimized fragments and view models, detected and eradicated deadlocks and memory leaks, improving slow frame and low memory issues.
- Adopted unit tests for modules under the UPI project, achieving 90% code coverage. 
- Designed a library to create statistical graphs in Jetpack Compose seamlessly and refactored code to achieve minimal re-compositions. 
- Designed and created architecture for web socket library for real-time chat and achieved seamless integration between backend APIâ€™s and complex UI elements of chat feature.

const String greedyGameDetails = """- Developed core Android library, which other developers can integrate to show native ads. Handling ~5 million ad requests/day.
- Refactored single monolithic codebase into multiple modules following facade, adapter, mediator design patterns, and more, applying good coding standards.
- Wrote wrappers for Unity Game Engine and Cocos-2dx using JNI, C#, and C++, facilitating the Android library to inject ads into games developed using them.
- Created a Unity game engine plugin that reduced developers' initial integration time from 1-2 days to less than 10 minutes. 
- Initiated development of the iOS plugin from scratch as a personal project by learning swift and iOS app development which was later incorporated as a separate product line in the organization attracting iOS app and game development companies into the business.
- Refactored the monolithic Backend written in NodeJS to microservices based architecture using Golang, which helped streamline the development and reduced overall development time, time for debugging issues, and time for deployment.
