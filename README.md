Prompt
Bro, Can you help me with creating a simple flutter website which is responsive. It should work both in mobile and web. It should have the following

Its a portfolio website

There should be a top navigation bar

In the left my name - NS ( When user hovers over the NS text it should expand to Nikhil Shankar C S and it should be clickable. It should redirect to my linked in page : https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikhilshankarcs/

In the right it should have Projects, Contact, Repos

First Section should be my profile photo and below it should be this intro :

"Hey I am Nikhil, Here I showcase things I've built and things Ive been passionate about.

Next Section Title : Projects - This section should contain cards. In the mobile it can be a horizontal list. In web it should be 3 items per row and vertically scrollable. Create a widget and add dummy content when you are creating. But dont create using loop. Create each card separately so that I can just replace text and Image for each card. Also when you click on a card it should have a redirection url.

In the end add a contact section and it should have links to my linkedIn, Github, Bitbucket, Playstore, Website etc

Please create it as an experienced flutter developer and make the code as easy to red and modify as possible.
